# NLP Coursework


This repository contains all the code and the instructions to replicate the results, for the Sentence-level Quality Estimation Shared Task 2020, as part of the Imperial College London Natural Language Processing course. The details of the task are discussed here: https://competitions.codalab.org/competitions/22831. Pearson score obtained on the blind test set was 0.1452

# Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Run ```jupyter notebook``` and open ```NLP_models_features.ipynb```
3. Execute the cells in order to replicate the performance achieved in the test set.


# Structure

- ```NLP_models_features.ipynb``` contains the code used to generate our top performing submission.
- ```this_other_file.ipynb``` contains the code for creating an LSTM model and performs parameter tuning. However, the top performing result for this method was 0.0872.
